//! Force data stored on the GPU
/*! Stores device pointers to allocated force data on the GPU. \a force[local_idx] holds the
	x,y,z componets of the force and the potential energy in w for particle \em local_idx.
	\a virial[local_idx] holds the single particle virial value for particle \em local_idx. See
	 ForceDataArrays for a definition of what the single particle virial and potential energy
	 mean.
	
	Only forces for particles belonging to a GPU are stored there, thus each array
	is allocated to be of length \a local_num (see gpu_pdata_arrays)
